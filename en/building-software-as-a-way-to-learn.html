<p>Today, I realized that I've been working for Mozilla for three years
already.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot, and with the storage team we have been part of a
number of different projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firefox Hello: Building a WebRTC signaling service.</li>
<li>MSISDN auth: Building a password less BrowserID authentication
service using a phone number.</li>
<li>Syncto: Browsing Firefox Sync using the Kinto protocol.</li>
<li>Kinto: Building synchronization services with backup and sharing
capabilities in mind.</li>
<li>RemoteServiceWorker: Building a Firefox Service Worker that does
heavy calculation in the cloud, to save battery life on mobile.</li>
<li>WebPush channels: Building a PubSub on top of WebPush</li>
</ul>
<p>While most of these projects have been built, deployed to production
and eventually decommissioned, some of them are still actively used by
Firefox users everyday.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-keep-motivated-building-things-that-are-thrown-away">
<h2>How do you keep motivated building things that are thrown away?</h2>
<img alt="Mozilla Dino Wallpaper" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/en/../images/dino.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>Let's be honest: everything we build â€” cars, houses, and even software â€”
is meant to be eventually thrown away. That's why recycling is so
important.</p>
<p>The question is why do we keep building them nevertheless?</p>
<p>Our daily job is to help Mozilla make the web a safe place for users
and prevent their privacy from being compromised.</p>
<p>One way of doing so is to build software that empowers people to
freely use the Internet while keeping them in charge of their own
data.</p>
<p>When users give their data to big companies, they don't necessarily
know that they are giving them too much power. As a result, these
companies are offering services that respond people's needs,
triggering an addictive behaviour which leads to an increase in
product consumption. Which lead people to give away even more
information about them.</p>
<p>We alone cannot compete with companies that are spending millions of
dollars building great products to capture users.</p>
<p>What we can do instead is to build software that, on the one hand, is
useful for the Mozilla mission and enables us to fix Mozilla issues
quickly while building Firefox and, on the other hand, empowers
developers to build their own great software where users can choose
where they want to store and control their data.</p>
<p>What matters the most is the vision that this software
carries. Without it, is like buiding on sand.</p>
<p>Sure, writing lines of code is cheap and fast. You can build a
prototype in two weeks and iterate until you are happy with the
Minimum Viable Product.</p>
<p>Note that, it might not be so cheap anymore when you start adding
documentation and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>However, the product might be used, and might get some traction for
months or even years but it will be eventually forgotten in a git
repository somewhere forever.</p>
<p>Writing software to solve problems is not enough to keep motivated on
the long term. One needs a greater goal than just writing code.</p>
<p>Having said that, how can one still be motivated on building things
that are eventually to be thrown away?</p>
<p>Different people or communities might have different guiding questions.</p>
<p>For our team of developers the secret for solving this problem is
actually the following question: As well as solving the problem, what
can we learn while building this solution that can be useful for us
and for our community to help us go faster and build more robust
software later?</p>
<p>For Mozilla the question is: How do I improve Firefox
so that people want to use it as their main browser?</p>
<p>By answering these two questions, we define our goals; and we fulfil
these goals through software development.</p>
<p>Mozilla is calling this the True North, we are calling it a vision,
some other people might call it a utopia.</p>
<p>In both cases that vision should set the route of our ambition and
point out a direction for everyone in the team to sail to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-set-course-for-a-vision">
<h2>How do you set course for a vision?</h2>
<img alt="Draken sailing to the North" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/en/../images/draken.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p><abbr title="Objectives and Key results">OKRs</abbr> are a way to organise the vision in steps and to move it
forward.</p>
<p>To be able to define OKRs from your vision, you need to be able to find
the fastest way to get closer to your aim. However what we can learn
from sailing is that the fastest way is rarely the shortest.</p>
<p>At Mozilla, we have a vision that is written down in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla
Manifesto</a>, Mitchell
Baker does a great job making sure everyone stays aligned with it.</p>
<p>However agreeing on the fastest way and turning the Mozilla vision
into OKRs is really challenging. Even more when you have a thousand
people's opinion about it.</p>
<p>The idea is to find the smallest and ambitious enough step for which
you can mesure the success in the timeframe you set to yourself.</p>
<p>It's the board's job to <a class="reference external" href="https://air.mozilla.org/mozilla-all-hands-hawaii-2016-20161221/">set course every six months</a> (or even less)
on what we should be focusing on for the next six months.</p>
<p>However each manager have to cut down the board objectives in
something that their team can have an action on.</p>
<p>When the focus changes, it often means changing our course and killing
projects or at least putting them on the side if teams are turning to
new priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-define-your-priorities">
<h2>How do you define your priorities?</h2>
<img alt="Mozilla Logo as a Sailing Map â€” From https://uk.pinterest.com/explore/firefox-logo/" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/en/../images/true-north.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>At our team level, we are driven by the use case. We have a vision of
what we want to build. That leads to feature ideas that we add to the
backlog.</p>
<p>However we are not building anything until we have a proper use case
for it. As soon as we have a use case it is added to our quarterly
roadmap.</p>
<p>We end up not spending time on tasks we don't need and for each use
case we are getting closer to our goal even if it might not be the way
we'd taken initially.</p>
<p>We also don't have to support code that we don't use. We even remove
features that are not used any more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-secret-is-opensource">
<h2>Our secret is opensource</h2>
<img alt="Open Source as a way to share" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/en/../images/open-source-software.png" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>More than writing lines of code, we are researching solutions to
complex problems at scale and turning those solutions into production
ready experiments. And sometimes those experiments fail.</p>
<p>The advantage we have at Mozilla, is that everything we do is
published as Free, Libre, Opensource Software, which means that, even
if, as Mozilla employees, we focus on something else, the work we've
done is still available for the community to care about it.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is an example of this. Mozilla stopped spending resources
on it in July 2012 but five years later Mozilla Thunderbird is still
actively used by a large number of users every day.</p>
<p>When building software, we solve complex issues and all the solutions
we have put together are really useful for other people who might need
to solve similar problems.</p>
<p>For instance, Mozilla Persona lead the ground for <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Firefox_Accounts">Firefox Accounts</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://portier.github.io/">Portier project</a>, the Firefox Hello <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/loop-server">loop server</a> shows a
good example of how to build a WebRTC signaling server and was reused
later by <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Connected_Devices/Projects/Project_Link">Project Link</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/remote-worker-server">Remote Service Worker project</a> also
shows how to use <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Python asyncio</a> to handle a large pool of
<a class="reference external" href="https://websockets.readthedocs.io/">websockets</a> using <a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/">redis</a> to route messages between them.</p>
<p>These are all valuable even though they are not in production anymore
today.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Building software as a way to learn</h2>
<img alt="Conference Room for DjangoCon Europe 2016" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/en/../images/conferences.jpg" style="width: 1347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>As you can see, every effort is not pointless because we learn a great
deal from all these projects.</p>
<p>Whether it takes us a month or a year to build something, we are
learning. And if you want to make the most value of this learning, it
is important to share it as well.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are at least one kind of people that you already have
to inform about what you are doing and learning about as part of your
job: your colleagues.</p>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>explain what you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>find out how to solve the issue and agree on the solutions you are
putting together.</li>
<li>take feedback to be able to choose the best solution even before
having written a single line of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a next article we will see how we make sharing the core of the
process of building software as a distributed team.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we can only encourage you to write about what you are
building, go to conferences and tell others about what you learned and
listen to them so that you don't have to go through the same pitfall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, don't build software to build software, build it to
solve people's problems. Set a long term goal, work toward that goal and
iterate. Do not be afraid of killing things that don't work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, make the process of building software a way to learn
new things and share what you've learn. Then you don't have to worry
about your project being decommissioned because you've already got the
take aways of building it.</p>
<p>Make the process of building software a way to share what you've
learned and enjoy it!</p>
