            <p>Kinto â€” the project we are working on since quite some time now â€” can do a bunch
of different things for you and be useful in many different situations.</p>
<p>However, we found out that it is really hard to understand at a glance what it
can do, and where it could help you build your projects in a better way.</p>
<p>Here is an attempt to fix this.</p>
<div class="section" id="kinto-is-not-a-framework">
<h2>Kinto is not a framework</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Kinto is not a framework. It doesn't try to provide a way
to structure your projects for you. It is meant to replace the
storage layer of your application, or more accurately, the synchronisation
abilities of your applications.</p>
<p>Said differentely, you store your data locally for your application and <strong>Kinto
will make this data available to different devices (or users)</strong>.</p>
<p>That means that you can use Kinto with React, Angular, JQuery (in the
JavaScript world) or any framework (or no framework at all) in any language.
<strong>Kinto abstracts away the synchronisation of the application's data</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hmm-and-what-about-my-use-case">
<h2>Hmm, and what about my use-case?</h2>
<p>The idea here is mainly to show you what is already possible with very little
efforts using the tooling we have put together. You can leverage the
<a class="reference external" href="https://kintojs.readthedocs.io">Kinto.js</a> client, as it allows you to work
with Kinto really easily, but ultimately you don't need it. It's just here to
make it really easy for you to integrate with the HTTP APIs exposed by Kinto.</p>
<div class="section" id="synchronise-your-data">
<h3>Synchronise your data</h3>
<p>If there is one thing to take way with you, that would be this: if you need to
<strong>synchronise</strong> your data between different devices, there are chances that
Kinto is a good fit.</p>
<p>That's useful if you want to synchronise data between devices, and also between
users. You have the data on one location, and you want it in a different one.</p>
<p>With <a class="reference external" href="https://kintojs.readthedocs.io">Kinto.js</a>, this is as simple as calling <cite>.sync()</cite> on the Kinto instance.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage">
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Okay, I lied. You are not only syncing your data between different locations,
you're actually storing it somewhere, on a location of your choice.</p>
<p>You can access this data later on when you need it. The cool thing here is that
you can access this data using the HTTP API (that speaks JSON).</p>
<p>We tried very hard to make the protocol as easy as possible, and are pretty
happy with our current design, but if you have ideas on how to make it evolve,
<a class="reference external" href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#kinto">we would be really happy to hear them</a>!</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to retrieve your data using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie">HTTPie</a> client.</p>

<div class="section" id="permissions">
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want your data to remain yours, and some other times you want to
share it with friends. It really depends what the data is.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we built Kinto was to control who has access to what on a
per record level. Without getting too much in the details, the data stored in
Kinto is organised into three concepts: Buckets contains collections wich in
turn contain records.</p>
<p>It's then possible to apply permissions to each container, and all children
will be impacted.</p>
<img alt="Concepts around permissions" class="align-center" src="https://mozilla-services.github.io/servicedenuages.fr/images/concepts-permissions.png" style="width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://kinto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/concepts.html">read more on our documentation</a> about this if you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="real-time-notifications">
<h3>Real-time notifications</h3>
<p>What happens when the data evolves? Let's say you are on one device doing
geo-mapping and someone else is doing the same thing on their own device. You
want to have these two devices in sync, and as such they need to know when new
data is issued by any other device.</p>
<p>That's when real-time notifications are useful. Kinto itself doesn't decide for
you which notification system you should use, but it can integrate easily with
any notification system.</p>
<p>We tried to ease your life by providing some solutions to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-pusher">integrate
with pusher</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-webpush">with WebPush</a>, but you're free to use your own
notification system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-examples">
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Let's take some examples. A few weeks ago we prepared a bunch of demos
showcasing what can Kinto do and how easy it is. In order to do that, we
decided to take a few applications we liked that are usually not doing
synchronisation and sharing. There are many out there, and we chose just a few of
them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>A tool to build forms</strong>, which makes a great alternative to Google Forms.</li>
<li><strong>A JQuery calendar application</strong> which let you add new events and see them
on a calendar.</li>
<li><strong>A leaflet map</strong> where you can add new markers and move them easily.</li>
<li><strong>A TODO-list application</strong>, because we actually really like TODO lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then we decided to make them collaborative apps, using Kinto. The goal here
was to spend the least time possible plugging in Kinto, in order to see what was
the real potential of it.</p>
<p>We ended up with a few cool demos. Not all of them are using the same features
of Kinto (for instance some take advantage of the push notifications while some
others don't), but overall that was pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Here are some links if you want to try out the demos yourself:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.fourmilieres.net">The formbuilder</a> with direct HTTP calls to
the Kinto APIs.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://leplatrem.github.io/kinto-demo-leaflet/">Kinto.js + Leaflet</a>
with offline-first maps which requires service workers activated
(only works in Firefox Nightly these days).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://leplatrem.github.io/cliquet-pusher/">Kinto.js + Leaflet + Pusher</a>
with realtime multi device map markers synchronisation using Pusher.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://leplatrem.github.io/kinto-demo-calendar/">Kinto.js + fullCalendar</a>
with realtime multi device synchronisation using Pusher and Firefox Account integration.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://leplatrem.github.io/kinto-telegram-wall/">Kinto.js + Telegram Bot + Pusher</a>
a realtime wall that receive messages from a Telegram bot and automatically updates the
slideshow in realtime and add the new content as soon as it arrives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our vision with Kinto is really to propose a simple tool for simple needs, and
to do these simple things the best way we can.</p>
<p>If you are interested by what Kinto has to propose, don't hesitate to
<a class="reference external" href="https://kinto.readthedocs.io">have a look at the documentation</a>,
try <a class="reference external" href="http://kintojs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/">the Kinto.js tutorial</a>

it as easy as possible for you.</p>
<p>Don't be shy, we are really here to help, and we want to know about your
use-cases!</p>
