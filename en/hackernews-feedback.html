            <p>Today, <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10733164">Kinto was featured on Hackernews</a>. We take this as a great
milestone for the project, even if it also comes with some sort of pressure and
stress :)</p>
<p>Since a few questions emerged from the thread there, we thought it'd be
appropriate to provide some answers here.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-does-this-name-mean">
<h2>What does this name mean?</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Nimbus">Kinto-un</a> is the name of the
Flying Nimbus in Dragon ball. It's said that "the cloud can only be ridden by
someone with a pure heart". Oh, well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maintaining-a-service-is-hard">
<h2>Maintaining a service is hard</h2>
<p>The main benefit of Firebase and Parse is that you don't have to run them.</p>
<p>That is true. We want to make it very easy to deploy / use. We can even
imagine to allow developers to run a Kinto instance in one-click on
DigitalOcean, Heroku or Bitnami.
We've started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Natim/auto-kinto-alwaysdata">by making the integration easy on Always Data</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, if someone runs a public Kinto instance and wants to charge for its usage,
that's completely fine!</p>
<p>At Mozilla, we just can't rely on third parties like Firebase or Parse for
critical data.</p>
<p>If you read french, we've written <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/difficile-promesse-autohebergement">an article about our vision on self-hosting</a>
(yes, we need to translate it! Any help would be welcome on this front.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-we-using-this-in-production">
<h2>Are we using this in production?</h2>
<p>We have different services that are leveraging Kinto:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The (now dead) reading-list project was using one of the first versions of
Kinto</li>
<li>We have made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncto">Syncto</a>:
a service which exposes the API of Kinto and talks with Firefox Sync in the
background, so that FirefoxOS developers can use the Kinto.js library</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently building (for 2016):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the distribution of fonts and hyphenation dictionaries for Firefox Mobile (Fennec)</li>
<li>the synchronization of addons blocklist and <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/03/03/revoking-intermediate-certificates-introducing-onecrl/">Certificate Revocation Lists (OneCRL)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Kinto.js <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/199296f7448fcfe12a3d84c7e16ca1752b740c0e">has landed in Firefox for that purpose</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="offline-first-support">
<h2>Offline-first support</h2>
<p>One of the core ideas behind <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js">Kinto.js</a> is
that it should be offline first: all operations can be done when online or
offline, and the data are synchronized when the connection goes back to normal.</p>
<p>Also, as we ship to these platforms, expect to see Android and iOS offline-first
clients coming along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-you-communicate-with-us">
<h2>How can you communicate with us?</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Our IRC channel <tt class="docutils literal">#kinto</tt> on <tt class="docutils literal">irc.freenode.net</tt>.  <a class="reference external" href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#kinto">Click here to access

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/kinto">The Kinto mailing list</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="realtime-updates-what-about-kinto">
<h2>Realtime updates, what about Kinto?</h2>
<p>When a record is modified, Kinto sends a notification on a pubsub channel. We
integrated Pusher.com and WebPush very recently.  Currently, the notification
payload contains the old and new version of the record. We plan on making
improvements, like sending diffs only. #babysteps #ftw!</p>
<p>Also, the current mecanism does not allow to send write operations via
websockets. Those are only sent via the REST API. We were recently talking
about abstracting the protocol into something different, but it's undecided as
of now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-re-missing-an-administration-panel">
<h2>You're missing an administration panel!</h2>
<p>This isn't actually true! One of our current focus is on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin">an admin panel</a>.</p>
<p>It's still fairly new but already available and useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-not-building-on-top-of-couchdb-pouchdb">
<h2>Why not building on top of CouchDB / PouchDB?</h2>
<p>We do realize CouchDB exists, and even think it's the best solution for a lot
of use cases. One of the first thing we did when we faced our first uses cases was to
see if CouchDB was a good choice for us, and eventually decided to not go for
it. You can read more about the rationale on our decision on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/generic-storage-ecosystem">the article</a></p>
<p>What we are doing with Kinto differs from what Couch/Pouch provide, in a bunch
of different ways. We don't actually want to step on each other toes, and
believe that Kinto and Pouch/Couch could actually live and be happy together
(we were even discussing last week about doing a bridge to Pouch in Kinto.js)</p>
<p>Now we need to let you with an explanation of how Kinto and Couch differs!</p>
<p>Kinto did the choice to <em>not</em> store the revisions that can be used for
master-master replication. One benefit out of it is that you don't need to
compress your database, resulting in smaller datasets.</p>
<p>It also means that we have a harder time dealing with conflicts, since we
cannot perform three way merges. We decided to let the application developers
manage conflicts â€” with user prompts or specific business logic for example â€”
and it fits our use cases pretty well.</p>
<p>Couch/Pouch also means that we had to deploy, scale and maintain technologies
that we don't master, and to which we weren't confident to contribute (CouchDB
is Erlang) whereas one of the original goals of Kinto is to be ops friendly.</p>
<p>Couch / Pouch is built on top of the concept of one database per user, and only
syncs entire databases. This is improving now, though.</p>
<p>As Dale Harvey pointed out, Kinto wants to handle fine-grained permissions.
After looking at how Couch is built and how complex it would have been to
include these fine-grained permissions in the protocol, we decided it would be
easier to actually do it from the ground up. We are aware of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thaliproject/node_acl_pouchdb">the
implementations of ACLs on top of Couch</a> and don't think their
tradeoffs are worth it.</p>
<p>There is a comparison with CouchDB (and many other solutions) <a class="reference external" href="http://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#comparison">in our
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Since the two solutions are solving slightly different problems, we will make
our best to guide the users towards the best for their use-case.  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/issues/330">We also plan
to extend this comparison table</a>
to compare products rather than server solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-are-also-developing-x-i-wonder-how-it-compares-with-x">
<h2>We are also developing X / I wonder how it compares with X</h2>
<p>A few years ago, we built <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spiral-project/daybed">Daybed</a>,
a similar project which never had the chance to be famous. At the time, the
page <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Backend_as_a_service">Mobile Backend as a service</a> did not even
exist on Wikipedia.  In early 2015, we decided to reboot the idea, based on
concrete use-cases that we had at Mozilla. It was not especially mobile
oriented, but each project milestone lead us to an ecosystem that is rich
enough to be compared with MBAAS.</p>
<p>We realize there are many (many) alternatives in the wild, like <a class="reference external" href="http://gun.js.org">http://gun.js.org</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="http://kuzzle.io">http://kuzzle.io</a> just to mention FOSS. Of course, Parse could also be
released under an open-source license some day.</p>
<p>For us, it mainly means that Kinto was a good idea!</p>
<p>We are a team of 5, and we don't pretend to knock down the tech of big
companies. We build Kinto with some ideals: a simple solution for simple needs
that is fully open-source.</p>
<p>We make our best to be transparent and humble, but there are so many solutions
out there. We probably missed many of them. So please help us guide the users
to choose the best solution for their use-case in our overview page!</p>
