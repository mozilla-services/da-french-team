Intentions
==========

* Not just a todolist, Routina is an app I'd actually use
* Put kinto.js in a real offline Web app
* Publish on Firefox Marketplace
* Use advanced APIs like Crypto, Alarm or Desktop notifications

Boiler plate
============

* Packaging & testing nightmare
* React and Webpack
* Live refresh
  - killer feature for Less/CSS

WebIDE
======

* Firefox Developper edition
* Live inspect on the phone

Plug Firefox OS
---------------

* Install android development
* Download platform

Open Web App
============

* Github pages
  - Webpack workflow
* Firefox Marketplace
  - Submit and wait for approval
